Single Sign-On (SSO) System with JWT and Google OAuth2 Integration:

Introduction:
In this project, I have developed a comprehensive Single Sign-On (SSO) system that leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication,authorization and integrates Google Authentication using OAuth 2.0. By using Spring Boot for backend development and React for the frontend, the project demonstrates a full-stack implementation of the authentication strategies.

Project Overview:
The SSO system enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications or services without needing to log in again for each one. This is achieved through the use of JWT, which ensures secure and stateless authentication. Additionally, by integrating Google OAuth2, users can log in using their Google accounts, streamlining the login process and enhancing user experience.
